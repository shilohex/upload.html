        <h1>My travel story</h1>
        <p class="blue"> Once upon a time, in a bustling city named Lagos, lived a young woman named excel. excel had a monotonous 9-to-5 job, but she always dreamt of something more - she dreamt of adventure.

            One day, she decided to take a leap of faith. She quit her job, packed her bags, and embarked on a journey around the world. Her first stop was the vibrant city of Paris. She marveled at the Eiffel Tower, strolled along the Seine, and tasted the best croissants she had ever had.</p>

        <h1>Love story</h1>
        <p class="blue">In the heart of Rome, two strangers, Maria and Carlo, bumped into each other near the Trevi Fountain. Their eyes met, and in that instant, they felt a connection. They spent the day exploring the city, sharing gelato, and laughing at each other's jokes.

            As the sun set, they made a wish at the fountain, promising to meet again if fate allowed it. They parted ways, their hearts filled with a sweet longing.
            
            Years later, they crossed paths again at the same fountain. This time, they decided not to leave their meeting to chance. From that day forward, Maria and Carlo were inseparable, their love story forever tied to the magic of Rome.</p>
